        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Skip the drive-thru and make irresistible seasoned fries at home. This seasoned french fry recipe creates <br>fries that are crispy on the outside, but fluffy and tender on the inside.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="recipe">
            <li>2 &frac12; pounds russet potatoes, peeled</li>
            <li>1 cup of vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>&frac12; cup water, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol class="recipe steps">
            <li>Slice potatoes into French fries and place them into a large bowl of cold water to prevent <br>them from turning brown.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a heavy saucepan or large skillet to 350 degrees F &#40;175 degrees C&#41;.</li>
            <li>While the oil is heating, sift flour, garlic salt, onion salt, paprika, and salt into a large bowl. Gradually stir in <br>enough water to make a slightly thick batter that can be drizzled from a spoon.</li>
            <li>Drain fries and pat dry; dip into the batter one at a time.</li>
            <li>Lower fries carefully into the hot oil in batches to prevent them from clumping together. Fry until <br>golden brown and crispy on all sides, about 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain fries on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve hot and enjoy!</strong></li>
        </ol>
